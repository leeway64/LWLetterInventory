# Letter Inventory

This project creates a class in R that holds an inventory of letters.

The specifications for this project is provided on the [UW Seattle CSE 143 autumn 2017 website](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/17au/homework.shtml). The original assignment was meant to be completed in Java, but I completed it in R for this project.
